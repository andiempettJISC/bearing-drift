# 3D Bearing Drift OpenSCAD Model

[3D Model](bearing-drift.stl)

A Customizable openscad model for a bearing drift Intended for use on bicycles. For example headset bearings.

May be used to create a makeshift bearing press. The extra parts are not included here but can be easily sourced. I've used an M8 300mm thread with M8 bolts and large washers.
As this is parameterized a whole range of bearings may be supported.

Don't print the drift to be very tight otherwise it may get stuck in the bike frame/component so its worth accurately measuring your tolerances before using.

This project cant be held responsible for any damage you choose to cause to your overpriced italian(chinese) carbon steed. Always have your bike serviced and repaired by a trained professional who has access to the correct tools!
